### About This Site

This URL address has been a number of years that visitor can be accessed to view my blog and portfolio.

This blog repeatedly changed its appearance. The previous version was built using WordPress, using the concept of Blogazine, which means that each article has a different appearance depending on the contents of the article.

Due to time constraints, it is often not updated anymore.

### Why Jekyll?

After previously using Wordpress, I finally decided to use Jekyll the open source static site generator. This blog will be used as a Github Page. Which means we will get free hosting and SSL from Github :)

### Contact Me

I also often do side project, for anyone who wants to collaborate can contact me via email at `yahya@yja.me`
