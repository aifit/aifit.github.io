I'm `Yahya J. Aifit`, Front-end Web Developer living & working in Jakarta, Indonesia.

I started working with HTML & CSS since 2008. Focus on minimalist design & prioritize the beauty of typography.

### About This Site

This URL address has been a number of years that visitor can be accessed to view my blog and portfolio.

This blog repeatedly changed its appearance. The previous version was built using WordPress, using the concept of Blogazine, which means that each article has a different appearance depending on the contents of the article.

Due to time constraints, it is often not updated anymore.

#### Why Jekyll?

After previously using Wordpress, I finally decided to use Jekyll the open source static site generator. This blog will be used as a Github Page. Which means we will get free hosting and SSL from Github :)
